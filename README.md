3900 Activity 2 is a simple website created by Rachael Tomaso for ISQA 3900.
This website should contain more than one HTML page and one or more pictures.
The two pages on this site are called "About Me" and "My Pets."
The "My Pets" page is the only page to contain pictures.
Bootstrapping is used to help with an accessable layout.
Pheonix Code was the main editor used to write and view the HTML and CSS for this Activity.
The website was created by Rachael Tomaso.
