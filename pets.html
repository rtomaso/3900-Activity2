                            <h3>Bob</h3>
                            <p>
                                Bob is 18 years young and was saved from the dreadful life of being a farm cat when he was still a kitten.
								He is probably the most spoiled cat in the world. <br><br>

                            <h3>Jasmine</h3>
                            <p>
                                Jasmine is 13 and is a drama queen. She is a Yellow Lab and was bred as a hunting dog. 
								The only problem is she hates getting her paws wet and wont even move if it looks like it might be raining.
                                She refuses to go anywhere without a teddy bear.<br><br>

                            <h3>Lily</h3>
                            <p>
                                Lily is also 13 and used to be my sisters dog. 
								She is a Wheaten Terrier and is kinda insain and probably isn't playing with a full deck of cards. 
								Her cute face makes up for it though. She is a toy hoarder.
